This Python script creates a 3D audio visualizer video from an audio file. It computes the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the audio to generate a spectrogram and visualizes it as a 3D surface plot over time.\
\
## Features\
- Convert an audio file to a NumPy array using PyDub\
- Compute STFT and extract frequency, time, and magnitude data\
- Generate a 3D spectrogram video with adjustable frame rate\
- Supports stereo audio conversion to mono\
\
## Dependencies\
- `numpy`\
- `matplotlib`\
- `pydub`\
- `scipy`\
- `opencv-python`\
\
Make sure you have these dependencies installed. You can install them with:\
```bash\
pip install numpy matplotlib pydub scipy opencv-python\
}
